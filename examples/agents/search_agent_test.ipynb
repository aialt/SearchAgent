The agent creation and orchestration technology behind Agentspace is now powering the core functionalities of the Gemini Enterprise platform. [Learn more.](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/introducing-gemini-enterprise?e=48754805)_\\\\n\\\\nAI is\\xa0 evolving beyond single, task-specific agents into an interconnected ecosystem, where autonomous agents collaborate\\xa0 to solve complex problems, regardless of their underlying platform. To make this transition easier for developers, we are announcing a comprehensive suite of tools that will empower developers to build, deploy, evaluate, and sell Agent2Agent (A2A) agents with Google Cloud.\\\\n\\\\n**Today,** **we’re excited to announce the release version 0.3 of the A2A protoco** **l**, which brings a more stable interface to build against and is critical to accelerating enterprise adoption. This version introduces several key capabilities, including gRPC support, the ability to sign security cards, and extended client side support in the Python SDK, which provide more flexible use, better security and easier integration.\\\\n\\\\nThe [A2A](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/) protocol is quickly gaining momentum, with support from a growing ecosystem of over [150 organizations](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/partners/) that spans every major hyperscaler, leading technology providers, and multinational customers using Google Cloud. Businesses are already building powerful capabilities for their organizations. For example, Tyson Foods and Gordon Food Service are pioneering collaborative A2A systems to drive sales and reduce supply chain friction, creating a real-time channel for their agents to share product data and leads that enhance the food supply chain.\\\\n\\\\n### **Build: Native support for A2A in the Agent Development Kit (ADK)**\\\\n\\\\nWe\\'re releasing native support for A2A in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](http://google.github.io/adk-docs/a2a/), a powerful open source\\xa0 agent framework released by Google. This makes it easy to build A2A agents if you are already using ADK and is built upon our previously-released A2A SDKs. For example, with a simple \\\\\"Hello, World!\\\\\" style code snippet, developers can now use ADK to:\\\\n\\\\n- Use an A2A agent with an Agent Card and use it as a sub-agent.\\\\n\\\\n- Expose an existing ADK agent to make it discoverable as an A2A agent.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDevelopers can start building collaborative agents with ADK today.\\\\n\\\\n### **Deploy: Flexible deployment options with Agent Engine, Cloud Run, and GKE**\\\\n\\\\nOnce agents are built, they need a robust and scalable home to exist within. We are providing three powerful deployment paths for customers to scale agents into production:\\\\n\\\\n- **Deploy to Agent Engine**: For a managed, agent-optimized environment, Agent Engine is the choice for many agent builders. We’re adding support for A2A to Agent Engine in the coming weeks so that you can easily deploy an agent written in any framework to Agent Engine and get a production ready, Google-scale, A2A agent.\\\\n\\\\n- **Deploy to Cloud Run**: For increased flexibility, you can containerize and deploy your A2A agents to Cloud Run, leveraging Google\\'s serverless infrastructure for massive scale and reliability. [Follow the published guide](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/host-a2a-agents).\\\\n\\\\n- **Deploy to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**: For maximum control, you can deploy agents to GKE, providing the full power of Kubernetes to manage A2A systems at scale.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWith support for A2A arriving in the coming weeks, developers will be able to use the \\\\\\\\`agent-starter-pack\\\\\\\\` CLI tool to complete CI/CD setup in just one line:\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nuvx agent-starter-pack create my-agent -a adk@gemini-fullstack\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### **Integrate: Bring your A2A agents to users with Agentspace**\\\\n\\\\nAgents need safe and accessible environments to be useful. That\\'s why we built Agentspace, the destination where agents meet end users. In the coming weeks, partners will be able to make any A2A agent available in Agentspace, transforming it from a standalone tool into a valuable service that people can consume. This includes partner-built agents that are built on partner platforms, giving customers the flexibility to access these A2A agents in multiple locations.\\\\n\\\\nMore than just a hub, Agentspace provides the critical governance, safety, and control features needed for an enterprise-ready agent platform, ensuring that interactions are secure and reliable.\\\\n\\\\n![https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/image1_M5Divwp.max-2000x2000.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/image1_M5Divwp.max-2000x2000.png)![https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/image1_M5Divwp.max-2000x2000.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/image1_M5Divwp.max-2000x2000.png)\\\\n\\\\n### **Evaluate and commercialize your A2A systems**\\\\n\\\\nBuilding and deploying agents is just the beginning. To create truly enterprise-grade systems, you need robust evaluation capabilities, which is why we’re extending the Vertex GenAI Evaluation Service to support A2A agent evaluations. See our [hands-on guidance](https://discuss.google.dev/t/using-vertex-ai-to-evaluate-an-example-a2a-agent/194032).\\\\n\\\\n### **Discover and sell partner-built A2A agents in AI Agent Marketplace**\\\\n\\\\nPartners can now sell their A2A agents directly to customers in the [AI Agent Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/browse?filter=category:ai-agent). This will allow Google Cloud customers to discover and purchase agents published by ISVs, GSIs, and other technology providers. The AI Agent Marketplace provides an important path to market for partners looking to monetize their AI Agents.\\\\n\\\\nPartners can request more information [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdnwSPA71m6GoETz9dIW-MvbmtlRqgl5Uc4kx6ztSEjM5TWTQ/viewform).\\\\n\\\\n### **The A2A ecosystem is growing**\\\\n\\\\nWe announced the A2A protocol in April to lead the industry toward interoperable agent systems, and in June, we advanced that commitment by [contributing it](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/google-cloud-donates-a2a-to-linux-foundation/) to the Linux Foundation. The industry\\'s response continues to grow, reflecting a shared belief in vendor-neutral, community-driven standards. Many of Google Cloud’s partners have previously offered agents to joint customers, and they are now enabling these agents with A2A to help future-proof investments for customers.\\\\n\\\\n- **Adobe:** A leader in generative AI, Adobe is leveraging the A2A protocol to make its rapidly-growing number of distributed agents interoperable with agents in Google Cloud’s ecosystem. The A2A protocol enables Adobe agents to collaborate in the enterprise to create powerful new digital experiences, streamline workflows that optimize the content creation process, and automate multi-system processes and data integrations.\\\\n- **S&P Global Market Intelligence:** S&P, a provider of information services and solutions to global markets, has adopted A2A as a protocol for inter-agent communication. This strategic alignment enhances interoperability, scalability, and future-readiness across the organization’s agent ecosystem.\\\\n- **ServiceNow:** As a founding partner of A2A, ServiceNow empowers customers with its AI Agent Fabric, a multi-agent communication layer that connects ServiceNow, customer, and partner-built agents. This provides enterprises with the greater choice and flexibility needed to unlock the full potential of agentic AI, resulting in faster decisions, fewer handoffs, and more scalable solutions.\\\\n- **Twilio:** Twilio is using A2A protocol for [implementing Latency Aware Agent Selection](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/developers/latency-extension-a2a). By extending the A2A protocol, individual agents now broadcast their latency, enabling the system to intelligently route tasks to the most responsive agent available and also adapt gracefully – for example, playing a filler prompt or adding typing sounds, if a high-latency agent is the only option.\\\\n\\\\nDevelopers can review more about past releases in the [release notes](https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A/releases), learn about what’s coming in the future in our [roadmap](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/roadmap/), and join the community to help evolve the protocol moving forward.\\xa0 The community has also released great tooling around A2A with the launch of [A2A Inspector](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-inspector) and [Technology Compatibility Kit](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-tck).\\\\n\\\\n### **Get started**\\\\n\\\\nWe’re excited to partner across the industry to build the future of artificial intelligence. Here’s how you can start:\\\\n\\\\n- Explore [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](http://google.github.io/adk-docs/a2a/) with A2A and build your first collaborative agent.\\\\n\\\\n- [Deploy it on Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/host-a2a-agents).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe can\\'t wait to see what you build.\\\\n\\\\nPosted in\\\\n\\\\n- [AI & Machine

Introduction [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#1-introduction \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nThe Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol is an open standard designed to facilitate communication and interoperability between independent, potentially opaque AI agent systems. In an ecosystem where agents might be built using different frameworks, languages, or by different vendors, A2A provides a common language and interaction model.\\\\n\\\\nThis document provides the detailed technical specification for the A2A protocol. Its primary goal is to enable agents to:\\\\n\\\\n- Discover each other\\'s capabilities.\\\\n- Negotiate interaction modalities (text, files, structured data).\\\\n- Manage collaborative tasks.\\\\n- Securely exchange information to achieve user goals **without needing access to each other\\'s internal state, memory, or tools.**\\\\n\\\\n### 1.1. Key Goals of A2A [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#11-key-goals-of-a2a \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\n- **Interoperability:** Bridge the communication gap between disparate agentic systems.\\\\n- **Collaboration:** Enable agents to delegate tasks, exchange context, and work together on complex user requests.\\\\n- **Discovery:** Allow agents to dynamically find and understand the capabilities of other agents.\\\\n- **Flexibility:** Support various interaction modes including synchronous request/response, streaming for real-time updates, and asynchronous push notifications for long-running tasks.\\\\n- **Security:** Facilitate secure communication patterns suitable for enterprise environments, relying on standard web security practices.\\\\n- **Asynchronicity:** Natively support long-running tasks and interactions that may involve human-in-the-loop scenarios.\\\\n\\\\n### 1.2. Guiding Principles [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#12-guiding-principles \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\n- **Simple:** Reuse existing, well-understood standards (HTTP, JSON-RPC 2.0, Server-Sent Events).\\\\n- **Enterprise Ready:** Address authentication, authorization, security, privacy, tracing, and monitoring by aligning with established enterprise practices.\\\\n- **Async First:** Designed for (potentially very) long-running tasks and human-in-the-loop interactions.\\\\n- **Modality Agnostic:** Support exchange of diverse content types including text, audio/video (via file references), structured data/forms, and potentially embedded UI components (e.g., iframes referenced in parts).\\\\n- **Opaque Execution:** Agents collaborate based on declared capabilities and exchanged information, without needing to share their internal thoughts, plans, or tool implementations.\\\\n\\\\nFor a broader understanding of A2A\\'s purpose and benefits, see [What is A2A?](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/topics/what-is-a2a/).\\\\n\\\\n### 1.3. Specification Structure [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#13-specification-structure \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nThis specification is organized into three distinct layers that work together to provide a complete protocol definition:\\\\n\\\\nProtocol Bindings\\\\n\\\\nJSON-RPC Methods\\\\n\\\\ngRPC RPCs\\\\n\\\\nHTTP/REST Endpoints\\\\n\\\\nCustom Bindings\\\\n\\\\nA2A Operations\\\\n\\\\nSend Message\\\\n\\\\nStream Message\\\\n\\\\nGet Task\\\\n\\\\nList Tasks\\\\n\\\\nCancel Task\\\\n\\\\nGet Agent Card\\\\n\\\\nA2A Data Model\\\\n\\\\nTask\\\\n\\\\nMessage\\\\n\\\\nAgentCard\\\\n\\\\nPart\\\\n\\\\nArtifact\\\\n\\\\nExtension\\\\n\\\\n**Layer 1: Canonical Data Model** defines the core data structures and message formats that all A2A implementations must understand. These are protocol agnostic definitions expressed as Protocol Buffer messages.\\\\n\\\\n**Layer 2: Abstract Operations** describes the fundamental capabilities and behaviors that A2A agents must support, independent of how they are exposed over specific protocols.\\\\n\\\\n**Layer 3: Protocol Bindings** provides concrete mappings of the abstract operations and data structures to specific protocol bindings (JSON-RPC, gRPC, HTTP/REST), including method names, endpoint patterns, and protocol-specific behaviors.\\\\n\\\\nThis layered approach ensures that:\\\\n\\\\n- Core semantics remain consistent across all protocol bindings\\\\n- New protocol bindings can be added without changing the fundamental data model\\\\n- Developers can reason about A2A operations independently of binding concerns\\\\n- Interoperability is maintained through shared understanding of the canonical data model\\\\n\\\\n### 1.4 Normative Content [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#14-normative-content \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to the protocol requirements defined in this document, the file `spec/a2a.proto` is the single authoritative normative definition of all protocol data objects and request/response messages. A generated JSON artifact (`spec/a2a.json`, produced at build time and not committed) MAY be published for convenience to tooling and the website, but it is a non-normative build artifact. SDK language bindings, schemas, and any other derived forms **MUST** be regenerated from the proto (directly or via code generation) rather than edited manually.\\\\n\\\\n**Change Control and Deprecation Lifecycle:**\\\\n\\\\n- Introduction: When a proto message or field is renamed, the new name is added while existing published names remain available, but marked deprecated, until the next major release.\\\\n- Documentation: This specification MUST include a Migration Appendix (Appendix A) enumerating legacy→current name mappings with planned removal versions.\\\\n- Anchors: Legacy documentation anchors MUST be preserved (as hidden HTML anchors) to avoid breaking inbound links.\\\\n- SDK/Schema Aliases: SDKs and JSON Schemas SHOULD provide deprecated alias types/definitions to maintain backward compatibility.\\\\n- Removal: A deprecated name SHOULD NOT be removed earlier than the next major version after introduction of its replacement.\\\\n\\\\n**Automated Generation:**\\\\n\\\\nThe documentation build generates `specification/json/a2a.json` on-the-fly (the file is not tracked in source control). Future improvements may publish an OpenAPI v3 + JSON Schema bundle for enhanced tooling.\\\\n\\\\n**Rationale:**\\\\n\\\\nCentering the proto file as the normative source ensures protocol neutrality, reduces specification drift, and provides a deterministic evolution path for the ecosystem.\\\\n\\\\n## 2\\\\\\\\. Terminology [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#2-terminology \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\n### 2.1. Requirements Language [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#21-requirements-language \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nThe keywords \\\\\"MUST\\\\\", \\\\\"MUST NOT\\\\\", \\\\\"REQUIRED\\\\\", \\\\\"SHALL\\\\\", \\\\\"SHALL NOT\\\\\", \\\\\"SHOULD\\\\\", \\\\\"SHOULD NOT\\\\\", \\\\\"RECOMMENDED\\\\\", \\\\\"MAY\\\\\", and \\\\\"OPTIONAL\\\\\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).\\\\n\\\\n### 2.2. Core Concepts [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#22-core-concepts \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nA2A revolves around several key concepts. For detailed explanations, please refer to the [Key Concepts guide](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/topics/key-concepts/).\\\\n\\\\n- **A2A Client:** An application or agent that initiates requests to an A2A Server on behalf of a user or another system.\\\\n- **A2A Server (Remote Agent):** An agent or agentic system that exposes an A2A-compliant endpoint, processing tasks and providing responses.\\\\n- **Agent Card:** A JSON metadata document published by an A2A Server, describing its identity, capabilities, skills, service endpoint, and authentication requirements.\\\\n- **Message:** A communication turn between a client and a remote agent, having a `role` (\\\\\"user\\\\\" or \\\\\"agent\\\\\") and containing one or more `Parts`.\\\\n- **Task:** The fundamental unit of work managed by A2A, identified by a unique ID. Tasks are stateful and progress through a defined lifecycle.\\\\n- **Part:** The smallest unit of content within a Message or Artifact (e.g., `TextPart`, `FilePart`, `DataPart`).\\\\n- **Artifact:** An output (e.g., a document, image, structured data) generated by the agent as a result of a task, composed of `Parts`.\\\\n- **Streaming:** Real-time, incremental updates for tasks (status changes, artifact chunks) delivered via protocol-specific streaming mechanisms.\\\\n- **Push Notifications:** Asynchronous task updates delivered via server-initiated HTTP POST requests to a client-provided webhook URL, for long-running or disconnected scenarios.\\\\n- **Context:** An optional, server-generated identifier to logically group related tasks and messages.\\\\n- **Extension:** A mechanism for agents to provide additional functionality or data beyond the core A2A specification.\\\\n\\\\n## 3\\\\\\\\. A2A Protocol Operations [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#3-a2a-protocol-operations \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nThis section describes the core operations of the A2A protocol in a binding-independent manner. These operations define the fundamental capabilities that all A2A implementations must support, regardless of the underlying binding mechanism.\\\\n\\\\n### 3.1. Core Operations [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#31-core-operations \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nThe following operations define the fundamental capabilities that all A2A implementations must support, independent of the specific protocol binding used. For a quick reference mapping of these operations to protocol-specific method names and endpoints, see [Section 5.3 (Method Mapping Reference)](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#53-method-mapping-reference). For detailed protocol-specific implementation details, see:\\\\n\\\\n- [Section 9: JSON-RPC Protocol Binding](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#9-json-rpc-protocol-binding)\\\\n- [Section 10: gRPC Protocol Binding](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#10-grpc-protocol-binding)\\\\n- [Section 11: HTTP+JSON/REST Protocol Binding](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#11-httpjsonrest-protocol-binding)\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.1.1. Send Message [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#311-send-message \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nThe primary operation for initiating agent interactions. Clients send a message to an agent and receive either a task that tracks the processing or a direct response message.\\\\n\\\\n**Inputs:**\\\\n\\\\n- [`SendMessageRequest`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#321-sendmessagerequest): Request object containing the message, configuration, and metadata\\\\n\\\\n**Outputs:**\\\\n\\\\n- [`Task`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#411-task): A task object representing the processing of the message, OR\\\\n- [`Message`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#414-message): A direct response message (for simple interactions that don\\'t require task tracking)\\\\n\\\\n**Errors:**\\\\n\\\\n- [`ContentTypeNotSupportedError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling): A Media Type provided in the request\\'s message parts is not supported by the agent.\\\\n- [`UnsupportedOperationError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling): Messages sent to Tasks that are in a terminal state (e.g., completed, canceled, rejected) cannot accept further messages.\\\\n\\\\n**Behavior:**\\\\n\\\\nThe agent MAY create a new `Task` to process the provided message asynchronously or MAY return a direct `Message` response for simple interactions. The operation MUST return immediately with either task information or response message. Task processing MAY continue asynchronously after the response when a [`Task`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#411-task) is returned.\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.1.2. Send Streaming Message [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#312-send-streaming-message \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nSimilar to Send Message but with real-time streaming of updates during processing.\\\\n\\\\n**Inputs:**\\\\n\\\\n- [`SendMessageRequest`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#321-sendmessagerequest): Request object containing the message, configuration, and metadata\\\\n\\\\n**Outputs:**\\\\n\\\\n- [`Stream Response`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#323-stream-response)object containing:\\\\n  - Initial response: [`Task`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#411-task) object OR [`Message`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#414-message) object\\\\n  - Subsequent events following a `Task` MAY include stream of [`TaskStatusUpdateEvent`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#421-taskstatusupdateevent) and [`TaskArtifactUpdateEvent`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#422-taskartifactupdateevent) objects\\\\n- Final completion indicator\\\\n\\\\n**Errors:**\\\\n\\\\n- [`UnsupportedOperationError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling): Streaming is not supported by the agent (see [Capability Validation](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#334-capability-validation)).\\\\n- [`UnsupportedOperationError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling): Messages sent to Tasks that are in a terminal state (e.g., completed, canceled, rejected) cannot accept further messages.\\\\n- [`ContentTypeNotSupportedError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling): A Media Type provided in the request\\'s message parts is not supported by the agent.\\\\n- [`TaskNotFoundError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling): The task ID does not exist or is not accessible.\\\\n\\\\n**Behavior:**\\\\n\\\\nThe operation MUST establish a streaming connection for real-time updates. The stream MUST follow one of these patterns:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Message-only stream:** If the agent returns a [`Message`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#414-message), the stream MUST contain exactly one `Message` object and then close immediately. No task tracking or updates are provided.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Task lifecycle stream:** If the agent returns a [`Task`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#411-task), the stream MUST begin with the Task object, followed by zero or more [`TaskStatusUpdateEvent`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#421-taskstatusupdateevent) or [`TaskArtifactUpdateEvent`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#422-taskartifactupdateevent) objects. The stream MUST close when the task reaches a terminal state (e.g. completed, failed, cancelled, rejected).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe agent MAY return a `Task` for complex processing with status/artifact updates or MAY return a `Message` for direct streaming responses without task overhead. The implementation MUST provide immediate feedback on progress and intermediate results.\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.1.3. Get Task [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#313-get-task \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nRetrieves the current state (including status, artifacts, and optionally history) of a previously initiated task. This is typically used for polling the status of a task initiated with message/send, or for fetching the final state of a task after being notified via a push notification or after a stream has ended.\\\\n\\\\n**Inputs:**\\\\n\\\\nRepresents a request for the `tasks/get` method.\\\\n\\\\n| Field | Type | Required | Description |\\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\\n| `tenant` | `string` | No | Optional tenant, provided as a path parameter. |\\\\n| `name` | `string` | Yes | The resource name of the task. Format: tasks/{task\\\\\\\\_id} |\\\\n| `historyLength` | `integer` | Optional | The maximum number of messages to include in the history. |\\\\n\\\\nSee [History Length Semantics](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#324-history-length-semantics) for details about `historyLength`.\\\\n\\\\n**Outputs:**\\\\n\\\\n- [`Task`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#411-task): Current state and artifacts of the requested task\\\\n\\\\n**Errors:**\\\\n\\\\n- [`TaskNotFoundError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling): The task ID does not exist or is not accessible.\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.1.4. List Tasks [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#314-list-tasks \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nRetrieves a list of tasks with optional filtering and pagination capabilities. This method allows clients to discover and manage multiple tasks across different contexts or with specific status criteria.\\\\n\\\\n**Inputs:**\\\\n\\\\nParameters for listing tasks with optional filtering criteria.\\\\n\\\\n| Field | Type | Required | Description |\\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\\n| `tenant` | `string` | No | Optional tenant, provided as a path parameter. |\\\\n| `contextId` | `string` | No | Filter tasks by context ID to get tasks from a specific conversation or session. |\\\\n| `status` | [`TaskState`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#TaskState) | No | Filter tasks by their current status state. |\\\\n| `pageSize` | `integer` | Optional | Maximum number of tasks to return. Must be between 1 and 100. Defaults to 50 if not specified. |\\\\n| `pageToken` | `string` | No | Token for pagination. Use the next\\\\\\\\_page\\\\\\\\_token from a previous ListTasksResponse. |\\\\n| `historyLength` | `integer` | Optional | The maximum number of messages to include in each task\\'s history. |\\\\n| `statusTimestampAfter` | `timestamp` | No | Filter tasks which have a status updated after the provided timestamp in ISO 8601 format (e.g., \\\\\"2023-10-27T10:00:00Z\\\\\"). Only tasks with a status timestamp time greater than or equal to this value will be returned. |\\\\n| `includeArtifacts` | `boolean` | Optional | Whether to include artifacts in the returned tasks. Defaults to false to reduce payload size. |\\\\n\\\\nWhen `includeArtifacts` is false (the default), the artifacts field MUST be omitted entirely from each Task object in the response. The field should not be present as an empty array or null value. When `includeArtifacts` is true, the artifacts field should be included with its actual content (which may be an empty array if the task has no artifacts).\\\\n\\\\n**Outputs:**\\\\n\\\\nResult object for tasks/list method containing an array of tasks and pagination information.\\\\n\\\\n| Field | Type | Required | Description |\\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\\n| `tasks` | array of [`Task`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#Task) | Yes | Array of tasks matching the specified criteria. |\\\\n| `nextPageToken` | `string` | Yes | Token for retrieving the next page. Empty string if no more results. |\\\\n| `pageSize` | `integer` | Yes | The size of page requested. |\\\\n| `totalSize` | `integer` | Yes | Total number of tasks available (before pagination). |\\\\n\\\\nNote on `nextPageToken`: The `nextPageToken` field MUST always be present in the response. When there are no more results to retrieve (i.e., this is the final page), the field MUST be set to an empty string (\\\\\"\\\\\"). Clients should check for an empty string to determine if more pages are available.\\\\n\\\\n**Errors:**\\\\n\\\\nNone specific to this operation beyond standard protocol errors.\\\\n\\\\n**Behavior:**\\\\n\\\\nThe operation MUST return only tasks visible to the authenticated client and MUST use cursor-based pagination for performance and consistency. Tasks MUST be sorted by last update time in descending order. Implementations MUST implement appropriate authorization scoping to ensure clients can only access authorized tasks. See [Section 13.1 Data Access and Authorization Scoping](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#131-data-access-and-authorization-scoping) for detailed security requirements.\\\\n\\\\n**_Pagination Strategy:_**\\\\n\\\\nThis method uses cursor-based pagination (via `pageToken`/`nextPageToken`) rather than offset-based pagination for better performance and consistency, especially with large datasets. Cursor-based pagination avoids the \\\\\"deep pagination problem\\\\\" where skipping large numbers of records becomes inefficient for databases. This approach is consistent with the gRPC specification, which also uses cursor-based pagination (page\\\\\\\\_token/next\\\\\\\\_page\\\\\\\\_token).\\\\n\\\\n**_Ordering:_**\\\\n\\\\nImplementations MUST return tasks sorted by their status timestamp time in descending order (most recently updated tasks first). This ensures consistent pagination and allows clients to efficiently monitor recent task activity.\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.1.5. Cancel Task [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#315-cancel-task \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nRequests the cancellation of an ongoing task. The server will attempt to cancel the task, but success is not guaranteed (e.g., the task might have already completed or failed, or cancellation might not be supported at its current stage).\\\\n\\\\n**Inputs:**\\\\n\\\\nRepresents a request for the `tasks/cancel` method.\\\\n\\\\n| Field | Type | Required | Description |\\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\\n| `tenant` | `string` | No | Optional tenant, provided as a path parameter. |\\\\n| `name` | `string` | No | The resource name of the task to cancel. Format: tasks/{task\\\\\\\\_id} |\\\\n\\\\n**Outputs:**\\\\n\\\\n- Updated [`Task`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#411-task) with cancellation status\\\\n\\\\n**Errors:**\\\\n\\\\n- [`TaskNotCancelableError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling): The task is not in a cancelable state (e.g., already completed, failed, or canceled).\\\\n- [`TaskNotFoundError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling): The task ID does not exist or is not accessible.\\\\n\\\\n**Behavior:**\\\\n\\\\nThe operation attempts to cancel the specified task and returns its updated state.\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.1.6. Subscribe to Task [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#316-subscribe-to-task \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nEstablishes a streaming connection to receive updates for an existing task.\\\\n\\\\n**Inputs:**\\\\n\\\\n| Field | Type | Required | Description |\\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\\n| `tenant` | `string` | No | Optional tenant, provided as a path parameter. |\\\\n| `name` | `string` | No | The resource name of the task to subscribe to. Format: tasks/{task\\\\\\\\_id} |\\\\n\\\\n**Outputs:**\\\\n\\\\n- [`Stream Response`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#323-stream-response)object containing:\\\\n  - Initial response: [`Task`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#411-task) object with current state\\\\n  - Stream of [`TaskStatusUpdateEvent`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#421-taskstatusupdateevent) and [`TaskArtifactUpdateEvent`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#422-taskartifactupdateevent) objects\\\\n\\\\n**Errors:**\\\\n\\\\n- [`UnsupportedOperationError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling): Streaming is not supported by the agent (see [Capability Validation](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#334-capability-validation)).\\\\n- [`TaskNotFoundError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling): The task ID does not exist or is not accessible.\\\\n- [`UnsupportedOperationError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling): The operation is attempted on a task that is in a terminal state (`completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`, or `rejected`).\\\\n\\\\n**Behavior:**\\\\n\\\\nThe operation enables real-time monitoring of task progress and can be used with any task that is not in a terminal state. The stream MUST terminate when the task reaches a terminal state (`completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`, or `rejected`).\\\\n\\\\nThe operation MUST return a `Task` object as the first event in the stream, representing the current state of the task at the time of subscription. This prevents a potential loss of information between a call to `GetTask` and calling `SubscribeToTask`.\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.1.7. Set or Update Push Notification Config [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#317-set-or-update-push-notification-config \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nCreates or updates a push notification configuration for a task to receive asynchronous updates via webhook.\\\\n\\\\n**Inputs:**\\\\n\\\\nRepresents a request for the `tasks/pushNotificationConfig/set` method.\\\\n\\\\n| Field | Type | Required | Description |\\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\\n| `tenant` | `string` | No | Optional tenant, provided as a path parameter. |\\\\n| `parent` | `string` | Yes | The parent task resource for this config.

When task updates occur, the agent will send HTTP POST requests to the configured webhook URL with [`StreamResponse`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#323-stream-response) payloads (see [Push Notification Payload](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#433-push-notification-payload) for details). This operation is only available if the agent supports push notifications capability. The configuration MUST persist until task completion or explicit deletion.\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.1.8. Get Push Notification Config [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#318-get-push-notification-config \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nRetrieves an existing push notification configuration for a task.\\\\n\\\\n**Inputs:**\\\\n\\\\n| Field | Type | Required | Description |\\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\\n| `tenant` | `string` | No | Optional tenant, provided as a path parameter. |\\\\n| `name` | `string` | No | The resource name of the config to retrieve.

If this field is omitted, there are no subsequent pages. |\\\\n\\\\n**Errors:**\\\\n\\\\n- [`PushNotificationNotSupportedError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling): Push notifications are not supported by the agent (see [Capability Validation](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#334-capability-validation)).\\\\n- [`TaskNotFoundError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling): The task ID does not exist or is not accessible.\\\\n\\\\n**Behavior:**\\\\n\\\\nThe operation MUST return all active push notification configurations for the specified task and MAY support pagination for tasks with many configurations.\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.1.10. Delete Push Notification Config [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#3110-delete-push-notification-config \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nRemoves a push notification configuration for a task.\\\\n\\\\n**Inputs:**\\\\n\\\\nRepresents a request for the `tasks/pushNotificationConfig/delete` method.\\\\n\\\\n| Field | Type | Required | Description |\\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\\n| `tenant` | `string` | No | Optional tenant, provided as a path parameter. |\\\\n| `name` | `string` | No | The resource name of the config to delete. Format: tasks/{task\\\\\\\\_id}/pushNotificationConfigs/{config\\\\\\\\_id} |\\\\n\\\\n**Outputs:**\\\\n\\\\n- Confirmation of deletion (implementation-specific)\\\\n\\\\n**Errors:**\\\\n\\\\n- [`PushNotificationNotSupportedError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling): Push notifications are not supported by the agent (see [Capability Validation](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#334-capability-validation)).\\\\n- [`TaskNotFoundError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling): The task ID does not exist.\\\\n\\\\n**Behavior:**\\\\n\\\\nThe operation MUST permanently remove the specified push notification configuration. No further notifications will be sent to the configured webhook after deletion. This operation MUST be idempotent - multiple deletions of the same config have the same effect.\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.1.11. Get Extended Agent Card [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#3111-get-extended-agent-card \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nRetrieves a potentially more detailed version of the Agent Card after the client has authenticated. This endpoint is available only if `AgentCard.capabilities.extendedAgentCard` is `true`.\\\\n\\\\n**Inputs:**\\\\n\\\\n| Field | Type | Required | Description |\\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\\n| `tenant` | `string` | No | Optional tenant, provided as a path parameter. |\\\\n\\\\n**Outputs:**\\\\n\\\\n- [`AgentCard`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#441-agentcard): A complete Agent Card object, which may contain additional details or skills not present in the public card\\\\n\\\\n**Errors:**\\\\n\\\\n- [`UnsupportedOperationError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling): The agent does not support authenticated extended cards (see [Capability Validation](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#334-capability-validation)).\\\\n- [`ExtendedAgentCardNotConfiguredError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling): The agent declares support but does not have an extended agent card configured.\\\\n\\\\n**Behavior:**\\\\n\\\\n- **Authentication**: The client MUST authenticate the request using one of the schemes declared in the public `AgentCard.securitySchemes` and `AgentCard.security` fields.\\\\n- **Extended Information**: The operation MAY return different details based on client authentication level, including additional skills, capabilities, or configuration not available in the public Agent Card.\\\\n- **Card Replacement**: Clients retrieving this extended card SHOULD replace their cached public Agent Card with the content received from this endpoint for the duration of their authenticated session or until the card\\'s version changes.\\\\n- **Availability**: This operation is only available if the public Agent Card declares `capabilities.extendedAgentCard: true`.\\\\n\\\\nFor detailed security guidance on extended agent cards, see [Section 13.3 Extended Agent Card Access Control](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#133-extended-agent-card-access-control).\\\\n\\\\n### 3.2. Operation Parameter Objects [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#32-operation-parameter-objects \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nThis section defines common parameter objects used across multiple operations.\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.2.1. SendMessageRequest [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#321-sendmessagerequest \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nRepresents a request for the `message/send` method.\\\\n\\\\n| Field | Type | Required | Description |\\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\\n| `tenant` | `string` | No | Optional tenant, provided as a path parameter. |\\\\n| `message` | [`Message`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#Message) | Yes | The message to send to the agent. |\\\\n| `configuration` | [`SendMessageConfiguration`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#SendMessageConfiguration) | No | Configuration for the send request. |\\\\n| `metadata` | `object` | No | A flexible key-value map for passing additional context or parameters. |\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.2.2. SendMessageConfiguration [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#322-sendmessageconfiguration \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nConfiguration of a send message request.\\\\n\\\\n| Field | Type | Required | Description |\\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\\n| `acceptedOutputModes` | array of `string` | No | A list of media types the client is prepared to accept for response parts. Agents SHOULD use this to tailor their output. |\\\\n| `pushNotificationConfig` | [`PushNotificationConfig`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#PushNotificationConfig) | No | Configuration for the agent to send push notifications for task updates. |\\\\n| `historyLength` | `integer` | Optional | The maximum number of messages to include in the history. |\\\\n| `blocking` | `boolean` | No | If true, the operation waits until the task reaches a terminal state before returning. Default is false. |\\\\n\\\\n**Blocking vs Non-Blocking Execution:**\\\\n\\\\nThe `blocking` field in [`SendMessageConfiguration`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#322-sendmessageconfiguration) controls whether the operation waits for task completion:\\\\n\\\\n- **Blocking (`blocking: true`)**: The operation MUST wait until the task reaches a terminal state (`completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`, `rejected`) before returning. The response MUST include the final task state with all artifacts and status information.\\\\n\\\\n- **Non-Blocking (`blocking: false`)**: The operation MUST return immediately after creating the task, even if processing is still in progress. The returned task will have an in-progress state (e.g., `working`, `input_required`). It is the caller\\'s responsibility to poll for updates using [Get Task](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#313-get-task), subscribe via [Subscribe to Task](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#316-subscribe-to-task), or receive updates via push notifications.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe `blocking` field has no effect:\\\\n\\\\n- when the operation returns a direct [`Message`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#414-message) response instead of a task.\\\\n- for streaming operations, which always return updates in real-time.\\\\n- on configured push notification configurations, which operates independently of blocking mode.\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.2.3. Stream Response [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#323-stream-response \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nA wrapper object used in streaming operations to encapsulate different types of response data.\\\\n\\\\n| Field | Type | Required | Description |\\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\\n| `task` | [`Task`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#Task) | No | A Task object containing the current state of the task. |\\\\n| `message` | [`Message`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#Message) | No | A Message object containing a message from the agent. |\\\\n| `statusUpdate` | [`TaskStatusUpdateEvent`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#TaskStatusUpdateEvent) | No | An event indicating a task status update. |\\\\n| `artifactUpdate` | [`TaskArtifactUpdateEvent`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#TaskArtifactUpdateEvent) | No | An event indicating a task artifact update. |\\\\n\\\\n**Note:** A StreamResponse MUST contain exactly one of the following: `task`, `message`, `statusUpdate`, `artifactUpdate`\\\\n\\\\nThis wrapper allows streaming endpoints to return different types of updates through a single response stream while maintaining type safety.\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.2.4. History Length Semantics [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#324-history-length-semantics \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nThe `historyLength` parameter appears in multiple operations and controls how much task history is returned in responses. This parameter follows consistent semantics across all operations:\\\\n\\\\n- **Unset/undefined**: No limit imposed; server returns its default amount of history (implementation-defined, may be all history)\\\\n- **0**: No history should be returned; the `history` field SHOULD be omitted\\\\n- **\\\\\\\\> 0**: Return at most this many recent messages from the task\\'s history\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.2.5. Metadata [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#325-metadata \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nA flexible key-value map for passing additional context or parameters with operations. Metadata keys and are strings and values can be any valid value that can be represented in JSON. [`Extensions`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#46-extensions) can be used to strongly type metadata values for specific use cases.\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.2.6 Service Parameters [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#326-service-parameters \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nA key-value map for passing horizontally applicable context or parameters with case-insensitive string keys and case-sensitive string values. The transmission mechanism for these service parameter key-value pairs is defined by the specific protocol binding (e.g., HTTP headers for HTTP-based bindings, gRPC metadata for gRPC bindings). Custom protocol bindings **MUST** specify how service parameters are transmitted in their binding specification.\\\\n\\\\n**Standard A2A Service Parameters:**\\\\n\\\\n| Name | Description | Example Value |\\\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\\\n| `A2A-Extensions` | Comma-separated list of extension URIs that the client wants to use for the request | `https://example.com/extensions/geolocation/v1,https://standards.org/extensions/citations/v1` |\\\\n| `A2A-Version` | The A2A protocol version that the client is using. If the version is not supported, the agent returns [`VersionNotSupportedError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling) | `0.3` |\\\\n\\\\nAs service parameter names MAY need to co-exist with other parameters defined by the underlying transport protocol or infrastructure, all service parameters defined by this specification will be prefixed with `a2a-`.\\\\n\\\\n### 3.3. Operation Semantics [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#33-operation-semantics \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.3.1. Idempotency [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#331-idempotency \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\n- **Get operations** (Get Task, List Tasks, Get Extended Agent Card) are naturally idempotent\\\\n- **Send Message** operations MAY be idempotent. Agents may utilize the messageId to detect duplicate messages.\\\\n- **Cancel Task** operations are idempotent - multiple cancellation requests have the same effect. A duplicate cancellation request MAY return `TaskNotFoundError` if the task has already been canceled and purged.\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.3.2. Error Handling [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#332-error-handling \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nAll operations may return errors in the following categories. Servers **MUST** return appropriate errors and **SHOULD** provide actionable information to help clients resolve issues.\\\\n\\\\n**Error Categories and Server Requirements:**\\\\n\\\\n- **Authentication Errors**: Invalid or missing credentials\\\\n  - Servers **MUST** reject requests with invalid or missing authentication credentials\\\\n  - Servers **SHOULD** include authentication challenge information in the error response\\\\n  - Servers **SHOULD** specify which authentication scheme is required\\\\n  - Example error codes: HTTP `401 Unauthorized`, gRPC `UNAUTHENTICATED`, JSON-RPC custom error\\\\n  - Example scenarios: Missing bearer token, expired API key, invalid OAuth token\\\\n- **Authorization Errors**: Insufficient permissions for requested operation\\\\n  - Servers **MUST** return an authorization error when the authenticated client lacks required permissions\\\\n  - Servers **SHOULD** indicate what permission or scope is missing (without leaking sensitive information about resources the client cannot access)\\\\n  - Servers **MUST NOT** reveal the existence of resources the client is not authorized to access\\\\n  - Example error codes: HTTP `403 Forbidden`, gRPC `PERMISSION_DENIED`, JSON-RPC custom error\\\\n  - Example scenarios: Attempting to access a task created by another user, insufficient OAuth scopes\\\\n- **Validation Errors**: Invalid input parameters or message format\\\\n  - Servers **MUST** validate all input parameters before processing\\\\n  - Servers **SHOULD** specify which parameter(s) failed validation and why\\\\n  - Servers **SHOULD** provide guidance on valid parameter values or formats\\\\n  - Example error codes: HTTP `400 Bad Request`, gRPC `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, JSON-RPC `-32602 Invalid params`\\\\n  - Example scenarios: Invalid task ID format, missing required message parts, unsupported content type\\\\n- **Resource Errors**: Requested task not found or not accessible\\\\n  - Servers **MUST** return a not found error when a requested resource does not exist or is not accessible to the authenticated client\\\\n  - Servers **SHOULD NOT** distinguish between \\\\\"does not exist\\\\\" and \\\\\"not authorized\\\\\" to prevent information leakage\\\\n  - Example error codes: HTTP `404 Not Found`, gRPC `NOT_FOUND`, JSON-RPC custom error (see A2A-specific errors)\\\\n  - Example scenarios: Task ID does not exist, task has been deleted, configuration not found\\\\n- **System Errors**: Internal agent failures or temporary unavailability\\\\n  - Servers **SHOULD** return appropriate error codes for temporary failures vs. permanent errors\\\\n  - Servers **MAY** include retry guidance (e.g., Retry-After header in HTTP)\\\\n  - Servers **SHOULD** log system errors for diagnostic purposes\\\\n  - Example error codes: HTTP `500 Internal Server Error` or `503 Service Unavailable`, gRPC `INTERNAL` or `UNAVAILABLE`, JSON-RPC `-32603 Internal error`\\\\n  - Example scenarios: Database connection failure, downstream service timeout, rate limit exceeded\\\\n\\\\n**Error Payload Structure:**\\\\n\\\\nAll error responses in the A2A protocol, regardless of binding, **MUST** convey the following information:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Error Code**: A machine-readable identifier for the error type (e.g., string code, numeric code, or protocol-specific status)\\\\n2. **Error Message**: A human-readable description of the error\\\\n3. **Error Details**(optional): Additional structured information about the error, such as:\\\\n   - Affected fields or parameters\\\\n   - Contextual information (e.g., task ID, timestamp)\\\\n   - Suggestions for resolution\\\\n\\\\nProtocol bindings **MUST** map these elements to their native error representations while preserving semantic meaning. See binding-specific sections for concrete error format examples: [JSON-RPC Error Handling](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#95-error-handling), [gRPC Error Handling](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#106-error-handling), and [HTTP/REST Error Handling](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#116-error-handling).\\\\n\\\\n**A2A-Specific Errors:**\\\\n\\\\n| Error Name | Description |\\\\n| --- | --- |\\\\n| `TaskNotFoundError` | The specified task ID does not correspond to an existing or accessible task. It might be invalid, expired, or already completed and purged. |\\\\n| `TaskNotCancelableError` | An attempt was made to cancel a task that is not in a cancelable state (e.g., it has already reached a terminal state like `completed`, `failed`, or `canceled`). |\\\\n| `PushNotificationNotSupportedError` | Client attempted to use push notification features but the server agent does not support them (i.e., `AgentCard.capabilities.pushNotifications` is `false`). |\\\\n| `UnsupportedOperationError` | The requested operation or a specific aspect of it is not supported by this server agent implementation. |\\\\n| `ContentTypeNotSupportedError` | A Media Type provided in the request\\'s message parts or implied for an artifact is not supported by the agent or the specific skill being invoked. |\\\\n| `InvalidAgentResponseError` | An agent returned a response that does not conform to the specification for the current method. |\\\\n| `ExtendedAgentCardNotConfiguredError` | The agent does not have an extended agent card configured when one is required for the requested operation. |\\\\n| `ExtensionSupportRequiredError` | Client requested use of an extension marked as `required: true` in the Agent Card but the client did not declare support for it in the request. |\\\\n| `VersionNotSupportedError` | The A2A protocol version specified in the request (via `A2A-Version` service parameter) is not supported by the agent. |\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.3.3. Asynchronous Processing [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#333-asynchronous-processing \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nA2A operations are designed for asynchronous task execution. Operations return immediately with either [`Task`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#411-task) objects or [`Message`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#414-message) objects, and when a Task is returned, processing continues in the background. Clients retrieve task updates through polling, streaming, or push notifications (see [Section 3.5](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#35-task-update-delivery-mechanisms)). Agents MAY accept additional messages for tasks in non-terminal states to enable multi-turn interactions (see [Section 3.4](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#34-multi-turn-interactions)).\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.3.4. Capability Validation [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#334-capability-validation \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nAgents declare optional capabilities in their [`AgentCard`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#441-agentcard). When clients attempt to use operations or features that require capabilities not declared as supported in the Agent Card, the agent **MUST** return an appropriate error response:\\\\n\\\\n- **Push Notifications**: If `AgentCard.capabilities.pushNotifications` is `false` or not present, operations related to push notification configuration (Set, Get, List, Delete) **MUST** return [`PushNotificationNotSupportedError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling).\\\\n- **Streaming**: If `AgentCard.capabilities.streaming` is `false` or not present, attempts to use `SendStreamingMessage` or `SubscribeToTask` operations **MUST** return [`UnsupportedOperationError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling).\\\\n- **Extended Agent Card**: If `AgentCard.capabilities.extendedAgentCard` is `false` or not present, attempts to call the Get Extended Agent Card operation **MUST** return [`UnsupportedOperationError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling). If the agent declares support but has not configured an extended card, it **MUST** return [`ExtendedAgentCardNotConfiguredError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling).\\\\n- **Extensions**: When a client requests use of an extension marked as `required: true` in the Agent Card but the client does not declare support for it, the agent **MUST** return [`ExtensionSupportRequiredError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling).\\\\n\\\\nClients **SHOULD** validate capability support by examining the Agent Card before attempting operations that require optional capabilities.\\\\n\\\\n### 3.4. Multi-Turn Interactions [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#34-multi-turn-interactions \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nThe A2A protocol supports multi-turn conversations through context identifiers and task references, enabling agents to maintain conversational continuity across multiple interactions.\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.4.1. Context Identifier Semantics [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#341-context-identifier-semantics \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nA `contextId` is an identifier that logically groups multiple related [`Task`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#411-task) and [`Message`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#414-message) objects, providing continuity across a series of interactions.\\\\n\\\\n**Generation and Assignment:**\\\\n\\\\n- Agents **MUST** generate a new `contextId` when processing a [`Message`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#414-message) that does not include a `contextId` field\\\\n- The generated `contextId` **MUST** be included in the response (either [`Task`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#411-task) or [`Message`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#414-message))\\\\n- Agents **MUST** accept and preserve client-provided `contextId` values if validations pass (i.e., it doesn\\'t conflict with provided `taskId`)\\\\n- `contextId` values **SHOULD** be treated as opaque identifiers by clients\\\\n\\\\n**Grouping and Scope:**\\\\n\\\\n- A `contextId` logically groups multiple [`Task`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#411-task) objects and [`Message`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#414-message) objects that are part of the same conversational context\\\\n- All tasks and messages with the same `contextId` **SHOULD** be treated as part of the same conversational session\\\\n- Agents **MAY** use the `contextId` to maintain internal state, conversational history, or LLM context across multiple interactions\\\\n- Agents **MAY** implement context expiration or cleanup policies and **SHOULD** document any such policies\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.4.2. Multi-Turn Conversation Patterns [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#342-multi-turn-conversation-patterns \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nThe A2A protocol supports several patterns for multi-turn interactions:\\\\n\\\\n**Context Continuity:**\\\\n\\\\n- [`Task`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#411-task) objects maintain conversation context through the `contextId` field\\\\n- Clients **MAY** include the `contextId` in subsequent messages to indicate continuation of a previous interaction\\\\n- Clients **MAY** use `taskId` (with or without `contextId`) to continue or refine a specific task\\\\n- Clients **MAY** use `contextId` without `taskId` to start a new task within an existing conversation context\\\\n- Agents **MUST** infer `contextId` from the task if only `taskId` is provided\\\\n- Agents **MUST** reject messages containing mismatching `contextId` and `taskId` (i.e., the provided `contextId` is different from that of the referenced [`Task`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#411-task)).\\\\n\\\\n**Input Required State:**\\\\n\\\\n- Agents can request additional input mid-processing by transitioning a task to the `input-required` state\\\\n- The client continues the interaction by sending a new message with the same `taskId` and `contextId`\\\\n\\\\n**Follow-up Messages:**\\\\n\\\\n- Clients can send additional messages with `taskId` references to continue or refine existing tasks\\\\n- Clients **SHOULD** use the `referenceTaskIds` field in [`Message`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#414-message) to explicitly reference related tasks\\\\n- Agents **SHOULD** use referenced tasks to understand the context and intent of follow-up requests\\\\n\\\\n**Context Inheritance:**\\\\n\\\\n- New tasks created within the same `contextId` can inherit context from previous interactions\\\\n- Agents **SHOULD** leverage the shared `contextId` to provide contextually relevant responses\\\\n\\\\n### 3.5. Task Update Delivery Mechanisms [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#35-task-update-delivery-mechanisms \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nThe A2A protocol provides three complementary mechanisms for clients to receive updates about task progress and completion.\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.5.1. Overview of Update Mechanisms [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#351-overview-of-update-mechanisms \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\n**Polling (Get Task):**\\\\n\\\\n- Client periodically calls Get Task ( [Section 3.1.3](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#313-get-task)) to check task status\\\\n- Simple to implement, works with all protocol bindings\\\\n- Higher latency, potential for unnecessary requests\\\\n- Best for: Simple integrations, infrequent updates, clients behind restrictive firewalls\\\\n\\\\n**Streaming:**\\\\n\\\\n- Real-time delivery of events as they occur\\\\n- Operations: Stream Message ( [Section 3.1.2](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#312-send-streaming-message)) and Subscribe to Task ( [Section 3.1.6](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#316-subscribe-to-task))\\\\n- Low latency, efficient for frequent updates\\\\n- Requires persistent connection support\\\\n- Best for: Interactive applications, real-time dashboards, live progress monitoring\\\\n- Requires `AgentCard.capabilities.streaming` to be `true`\\\\n\\\\n**Push Notifications (WebHooks):**\\\\n\\\\n- Agent sends HTTP POST requests to client-registered endpoints when task state changes\\\\n- Client does not maintain persistent connection\\\\n- Asynchronous delivery, client must be reachable via HTTP\\\\n- Best for: Server-to-server integrations, long-running tasks, event-driven architectures\\\\n- Operations: Set ( [Section 3.1.7](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#75-taskspushnotificationconfigset)), Get ( [Section 3.1.8](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#76-taskspushnotificationconfigget)), List ( [Section 3.1.9](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#319-list-push-notification-configs)), Delete ( [Section 3.1.10](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#3110-delete-push-notification-config))\\\\n- Event types: TaskStatusUpdateEvent ( [Section 4.2.1](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#421-taskstatusupdateevent)), TaskArtifactUpdateEvent ( [Section 4.2.2](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#422-taskartifactupdateevent)), WebHook payloads ( [Section 4.3](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#43-push-notification-objects))\\\\n- Requires `AgentCard.capabilities.pushNotifications` to be `true`\\\\n- Regardless of the protocol binding being used by the agent, WebHook calls use plain HTTP and the JSON payloads as defined in the HTTP protocol binding\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.5.2. Streaming Event Delivery [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#352-streaming-event-delivery \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\n**Event Ordering:**\\\\n\\\\nAll implementations MUST deliver events in the order they were generated. Events MUST NOT be reordered during transmission, regardless of protocol binding.\\\\n\\\\n**Multiple Streams Per Task:**\\\\n\\\\nAn agent MAY serve multiple concurrent streams to one or more clients for the same task. This allows multiple clients (or the same client with multiple connections) to independently subscribe to and receive updates about a task\\'s progress.\\\\n\\\\nWhen multiple streams are active for a task:\\\\n\\\\n- Events MUST be broadcast to all active streams for that task\\\\n- Each stream MUST receive the same events in the same order\\\\n- Closing one stream MUST NOT affect other active streams for the same task\\\\n- The task lifecycle is independent of any individual stream\\'s lifecycle\\\\n\\\\nThis capability enables scenarios such as:\\\\n\\\\n- Multiple team members monitoring the same long-running task\\\\n- A client reconnecting to a task after a network interruption by opening a new stream\\\\n- Different applications or dashboards displaying real-time updates for the same task\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.5.3. Push Notification Delivery [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#353-push-notification-delivery \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nPush notifications are delivered via HTTP POST to client-registered webhook endpoints. The delivery semantics and reliability guarantees are defined in [Section 4.3](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#43-push-notification-objects).\\\\n\\\\n### 3.6 Versioning [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#36-versioning \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nThe specific version of the A2A protocol in use is identified using the `Major.Minor` elements (e.g. `1.0`) of the corresponding A2A specification version. Patch version numbers used by the specification, do not affect protocol compatibility. Patch version numbers SHOULD NOT be used in requests, responses and Agent Cards, and MUST not be considered when clients and servers negotiate protocol versions.\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.6.1 Client Responsibilities [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#361-client-responsibilities \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nIt is RECOMMENDED that clients send the `A2A-Version` header with each request to maintain compatibility after an agent upgrades to a new version of the protocol. Sending the `A2A-Version` header also provides visibility to agents about version usage in the ecosystem, which can help inform the risks of inplace version upgrades.\\\\n\\\\n**Example of HTTP GET Request with Version Header:**\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nGET /tasks/task-123 HTTP/1.1\\\\nHost: agent.example.com\\\\nA2A-Version: 1.0\\\\nAuthorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...\\\\nAccept: application/json\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.6.2 Server Responsibilities [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#362-server-responsibilities \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nAgents MUST process requests using the semantics of the requested `A2A-Version` (matching `Major.Minor`). If the version is not supported, agents MUST return a [`VersionNotSupportedError`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling).\\\\n\\\\nAgents SHOULD declare their supported protocol versions in the `protocolVersions` field of their Agent Card:\\\\n\\\\n- **For stable versions (1.x and above):** Backward compatibility within a major version is required. An agent supporting version `1.2` must also support `1.0` and `1.1`. Only the latest supported minor version per major version needs to be listed.\\\\n- **For legacy experimental versions (0.x):** These early versions introduced breaking changes between minor versions. Agents that still support any `0.x` versions MUST explicitly list each one they support.\\\\n\\\\n**Example of Agent Card with Supported Protocol Versions:**\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\n  \\\\\"agentId\\\\\": \\\\\"agent-123\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"name\\\\\": \\\\\"Example Agent\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"protocolVersions\\\\\": [\\\\\"0.3\\\\\", \\\\\"1.1\\\\\"]\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe above example indicates that the agent supports A2A protocol versions `0.3`, `1.0` and `1.1`.\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.6.3 Client Fallback [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#363-client-fallback \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nClients that receive a `VersionNotSupportedError` can choose to retry the request with an earlier supported version, or fail the request. This explicit failure handling helps prevent unexpected behavior that could arise if an agent processes a request containing protocol features or fields it does not recognize.\\\\n\\\\n#### 3.6.4 Tooling support [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#364-tooling-support \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nTooling libraries and SDKs that implement the A2A protocol SHOULD provide mechanisms to help clients manage protocol versioning, such as providing configuration options to enable automatic fallback to earlier versions when a `VersionNotSupportedError` is encountered. Client Agents that require the latest features of the protocol should not enable automatic fallback, to avoid silently losing functionality.\\\\n\\\\n## 4\\\\\\\\. Protocol Data Model [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#4-protocol-data-model \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nThe A2A protocol defines a canonical data model using Protocol Buffers. All protocol bindings **MUST** provide functionally equivalent representations of these data structures.\\\\n\\\\n### 4.1. Core Objects [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#41-core-objects \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\n#### 4.1.1. Task [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#411-task \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nTask is the core unit of action for A2A.

This is a terminal state. |\\\\n| `TASK_STATE_AUTH_REQUIRED` | Represents the state that some authentication is needed from the upstream client. Authentication is expected to come out-of-band thus this is not an interrupted or terminal state. |\\\\n\\\\n#### 4.1.4. Message [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#414-message \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nMessage is one unit of communication between client and server. It can be associated with a context and/or a task. For server messages, context\\\\\\\\_id must be provided, and task\\\\\\\\_id only if a task was created. For client messages, both fields are optional, with the caveat that if both are provided, they have to match (the context\\\\\\\\_id has to be the one that is set on the task).

JSON Field Naming Convention [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#55-json-field-naming-convention \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nAll JSON serializations of the A2A protocol data model **MUST** use **camelCase** naming for field names, not the snake\\\\\\\\_case convention used in Protocol Buffer definitions.\\\\n\\\\n**Naming Convention:**\\\\n\\\\n- Protocol Buffer field: `protocol_versions` → JSON field: `protocolVersions`\\\\n- Protocol Buffer field: `context_id` → JSON field: `contextId`\\\\n- Protocol Buffer field: `default_input_modes` → JSON field: `defaultInputModes`\\\\n- Protocol Buffer field: `push_notification_config` → JSON field: `pushNotificationConfig`\\\\n\\\\n**Enum Values:**\\\\n\\\\n- Enum values **MUST** be represented as their string names in JSON, using lower [kebab-case](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Kebab_case) after removing any type name prefixes.\\\\n\\\\n**Examples:**\\\\n\\\\n- Protocol Buffer enum: `TASK_STATE_INPUT_REQUIRED` → JSON value: `input-required`\\\\n- Protocol Buffer enum: `ROLE_USER` → JSON value: `user`\\\\n\\\\n### 5.6. Data Type Conventions [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#56-data-type-conventions \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nThis section documents conventions for common data types used throughout the A2A protocol, particularly as they apply to protocol bindings.\\\\n\\\\n#### 5.6.1. Timestamps [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#561-timestamps \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nThe A2A protocol uses [`google.protobuf.Timestamp`](https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/google.protobuf/#timestamp) for all timestamp fields in the Protocol Buffer definitions. When serialized to JSON (in JSON-RPC, HTTP/REST, or other JSON-based bindings), these timestamps **MUST** be represented as ISO 8601 formatted strings in UTC timezone.\\\\n\\\\n**Format Requirements:**\\\\n\\\\n- **Format:** ISO 8601 combined date and time representation\\\\n- **Timezone:** UTC (denoted by \\'Z\\' suffix)\\\\n- **Precision:** Millisecond precision **SHOULD** be used where available\\\\n- **Pattern:**`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`\\\\n\\\\n**Examples:**\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\n  \\\\\"timestamp\\\\\": \\\\\"2025-10-28T10:30:00.000Z\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"createdAt\\\\\": \\\\\"2025-10-28T14:25:33.142Z\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"lastModified\\\\\": \\\\\"2025-10-31T17:45:22.891Z\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Implementation Notes:**\\\\n\\\\n- Protocol Buffer\\'s `google.protobuf.Timestamp` represents time as seconds since Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC) plus nanoseconds\\\\n- JSON serialization automatically converts this to ISO 8601 format when using standard Protocol Buffer JSON encoding\\\\n- Clients and servers **MUST** parse and generate ISO 8601 timestamps correctly\\\\n- When millisecond precision is not available, the fractional seconds portion **MAY** be omitted or zero-filled\\\\n- Timestamps **MUST NOT** include timezone offsets other than \\'Z\\' (all times are UTC)\\\\n\\\\n### 5.7. Field Presence and Optionality [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#57-field-presence-and-optionality \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nThe Protocol Buffer definition in `specification/grpc/a2a.proto` uses [`google.api.field_behavior`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/field_behavior.proto) annotations to indicate whether fields are `REQUIRED`. These annotations serve as both documentation and validation hints for implementations.\\\\n\\\\n**Required Fields:**\\\\n\\\\nFields marked with `[(google.api.field_behavior) = REQUIRED]` indicate that the field **MUST** be present and set in valid messages. Implementations **SHOULD** validate these requirements and reject messages with missing required fields. Arrays marked as required **MUST** contain at least one element.\\\\n\\\\n**Optional Field Presence:**\\\\n\\\\nThe Protocol Buffer `optional` keyword is used to distinguish between a field being explicitly set versus omitted. This distinction is critical for two scenarios:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Explicit Default Values:** Some fields in the specification define default values that differ from Protocol Buffer\\'s implicit defaults (e.g., `protocolVersions` defaults to `[\\\\\"1.0\\\\\"]` rather than an empty array). Implementations should apply the default value when the field is not explicitly provided.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Agent Card Canonicalization:** When creating cryptographic signatures of Agent Cards, it is required to produce a canonical JSON representation. The `optional` keyword enables implementations to distinguish between fields that were explicitly set (and should be included in the canonical form) versus fields that were omitted (and should be excluded from canonicalization). This ensures Agent Cards can be reconstructed to accurately match their signature.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Unrecognized Fields:**\\\\n\\\\nImplementations **SHOULD** ignore unrecognized fields in messages, allowing for forward compatibility as the protocol evolves.\\\\n\\\\n## 6\\\\\\\\.

Authentication and Authorization [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#7-authentication-and-authorization \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nA2A treats agents as standard enterprise applications, relying on established web security practices. Identity information is handled at the protocol layer, not within A2A semantics.\\\\n\\\\nFor a comprehensive guide on enterprise security aspects, see [Enterprise-Ready Features](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/topics/enterprise-ready/).\\\\n\\\\n### 7.1. Protocol Security [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#71-protocol-security \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nProduction deployments **MUST** use encrypted communication (HTTPS for HTTP-based bindings, TLS for gRPC). Implementations **SHOULD** use modern TLS configurations (TLS 1.3+ recommended) with strong cipher suites.\\\\n\\\\n### 7.2. Server Identity Verification [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#72-server-identity-verification \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nA2A Clients **SHOULD** verify the A2A Server\\'s identity by validating its TLS certificate against trusted certificate authorities (CAs) during the TLS handshake.\\\\n\\\\n### 7.3. Client Authentication Process [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#73-client-authentication-process \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\n1. **Discovery of Requirements:** The client discovers the server\\'s required authentication schemes via the `securitySchemes` field in the AgentCard.\\\\n2. **Credential Acquisition (Out-of-Band):** The client obtains the necessary credentials through an out-of-band process specific to the required authentication scheme.\\\\n3. **Credential Transmission:** The client includes these credentials in protocol-appropriate headers or metadata for every A2A request.\\\\n\\\\n### 7.4. Server Authentication Responsibilities [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#74-server-authentication-responsibilities \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nThe A2A Server:\\\\n\\\\n- **MUST** authenticate every incoming request based on the provided credentials and its declared authentication requirements.\\\\n- **SHOULD** use appropriate binding-specific error codes for authentication challenges or rejections.\\\\n- **SHOULD** provide relevant authentication challenge information with error responses.\\\\n\\\\n### 7.5. In-Task Authentication (Secondary Credentials) [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#75-in-task-authentication-secondary-credentials \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nIf an agent requires additional credentials during task execution:\\\\n\\\\n1. It **SHOULD** transition the A2A task to the `TASK_STATE_AUTH_REQUIRED` state.\\\\n2. The accompanying `TaskStatus.update` **SHOULD** provide details about the required secondary authentication.\\\\n3. The A2A Client obtains these credentials out-of-band and provides them in a subsequent message request.\\\\n\\\\n### 7.6. Authorization [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#76-authorization \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nOnce authenticated, the A2A Server authorizes requests based on the authenticated identity and its own policies. Authorization logic is implementation-specific and **MAY** consider:\\\\n\\\\n- Specific skills requested\\\\n- Actions attempted within tasks\\\\n- Data access policies\\\\n- OAuth scopes (if applicable)\\\\n\\\\n## 8\\\\\\\\. Agent Discovery: The Agent Card [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#8-agent-discovery-the-agent-card \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\n### 8.1. Purpose [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#81-purpose \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nA2A Servers **MUST** make an Agent Card available. The Agent Card describes the server\\'s identity, capabilities, skills, and interaction requirements. Clients use this information for discovering suitable agents and configuring interactions.\\\\n\\\\nFor more on discovery strategies, see the [Agent Discovery guide](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/topics/agent-discovery/).\\\\n\\\\n### 8.2. Discovery Mechanisms [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#82-discovery-mechanisms \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nClients can find Agent Cards through:\\\\n\\\\n- **Well-Known URI:** Accessing `https://{server_domain}/.well-known/agent-card.json`\\\\n- **Registries/Catalogs:** Querying curated catalogs of agents\\\\n- **Direct Configuration:** Pre-configured Agent Card URLs or content\\\\n\\\\n### 8.3. Protocol Declaration Requirements [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#83-protocol-declaration-requirements \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nThe AgentCard **MUST** properly declare supported protocols:\\\\n\\\\n#### 8.3.1. Supported Interfaces Declaration [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#831-supported-interfaces-declaration \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\n- The `supportedInterfaces` field **SHOULD** declare all supported protocol combinations in preference order\\\\n- The first entry in `supportedInterfaces` represents the preferred interface\\\\n- Each interface **MUST** accurately declare its transport protocol and URL\\\\n- URLs **MAY** be reused if multiple transports are available at the same endpoint\\\\n\\\\n#### 8.3.2. Client Protocol Selection [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#832-client-protocol-selection \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nClients **MUST** follow these rules:\\\\n\\\\n1. Parse `supportedInterfaces` if present, and select the first supported transport\\\\n2. Prefer earlier entries in the ordered list when multiple options are supported\\\\n3. Use the correct URL for the selected transport\\\\n\\\\n### 8.4. Agent Card Signing [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#84-agent-card-signing \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nAgent Cards **MAY** be digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS) as defined in [RFC 7515](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515) to ensure authenticity and integrity. Signatures allow clients to verify that an Agent Card has not been tampered with and originates from the claimed provider.\\\\n\\\\n#### 8.4.1. Canonicalization Requirements [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#841-canonicalization-requirements \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nBefore signing, the Agent Card content **MUST** be canonicalized using the JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS) as defined in [RFC 8785](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8785). This ensures consistent signature generation and verification across different JSON implementations.\\\\n\\\\n**Canonicalization Rules:**\\\\n\\\\n1. **Field Presence and Default Value Handling**: Before canonicalization, the JSON representation **MUST** respect Protocol Buffer field presence semantics as defined in [Section 5.7](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#57-field-presence-and-optionality). This ensures that the canonical form accurately reflects which fields were explicitly provided versus which were omitted, enabling signature verification when Agent Cards are reconstructed:\\\\n   - **Optional fields not explicitly set**: Fields marked with the `optional` keyword that were not explicitly set **MUST** be omitted from the JSON object\\\\n   - **Optional fields explicitly set to defaults**: Fields marked with `optional` that were explicitly set to a value (even if that value matches a default) **MUST** be included in the JSON object\\\\n   - **Required fields**: Fields marked with `REQUIRED` **MUST** always be present, even if the field value matches the default.\\\\n   - **Default values**: Fields with default values **MUST** be omitted unless the field is marked as `REQUIRED` or has the `optional` keyword.\\\\n2. **RFC 8785 Compliance**: The Agent Card JSON **MUST** be canonicalized according to RFC 8785, which specifies:\\\\n   - Predictable ordering of object properties (lexicographic by key)\\\\n   - Consistent representation of numbers, strings, and other primitive values\\\\n   - Removal of insignificant whitespace\\\\n3. **Signature Field Exclusion**: The `signatures` field itself **MUST** be excluded from the content being signed to avoid circular dependencies.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Example of Default Value Removal:**\\\\n\\\\nOriginal Agent Card fragment:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\n  \\\\\"name\\\\\": \\\\\"Example Agent\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"capabilities\\\\\": {\\\\n    \\\\\"streaming\\\\\": false,\\\\n    \\\\\"pushNotifications\\\\\": false,\\\\n    \\\\\"extensions\\\\\": []\\\\n  },\\\\n  \\\\\"skills\\\\\": []\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nApplying the canonicalization rules:\\\\n\\\\n- `name`: \\\\\"Example Agent\\\\\" - REQUIRED field → **include**\\\\n- `description`: \\\\\"\\\\\" \\\\\\\\- REQUIRED field → **include**\\\\n- `capabilities`: object - REQUIRED field → **include** (after processing children)\\\\n  - `streaming`: false - optional field, present in JSON (explicitly set) → **include**\\\\n  - `pushNotifications`: false - optional field, present in JSON (explicitly set) → **include**\\\\n  - `extensions`: \\\\\\\\[\\\\\\\\] \\\\\\\\- repeated field (not REQUIRED) with empty array → **omit**\\\\n- `skills`: \\\\\\\\[\\\\\\\\] \\\\\\\\- REQUIRED field → **include**\\\\n\\\\nAfter applying RFC 8785:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\\"capabilities\\\\\":{\\\\\"pushNotifications\\\\\":false,\\\\\"streaming\\\\\":false},\\\\\"description\\\\\":\\\\\"\\\\\",\\\\\"name\\\\\":\\\\\"Example Agent\\\\\",\\\\\"skills\\\\\":[]}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### 8.4.2. Signature Format [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#842-signature-format \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nSignatures use the JSON Web Signature (JWS) format as defined in [RFC 7515](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515). The [`AgentCardSignature`](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#447-agentcardsignature) object represents JWS components using three fields:\\\\n\\\\n- **`protected`** (required, string): Base64url-encoded JSON object containing the JWS Protected Header\\\\n- **`signature`** (required, string): Base64url-encoded signature value\\\\n- **`header`** (optional, object): JWS Unprotected Header as a JSON object (not base64url-encoded)\\\\n\\\\n**JWS Protected Header Parameters:**\\\\n\\\\nThe protected header **MUST** include:\\\\n\\\\n- `alg`: Algorithm used for signing (e.g., \\\\\"ES256\\\\\", \\\\\"RS256\\\\\")\\\\n- `typ`: **SHOULD** be set to \\\\\"JOSE\\\\\" for JWS\\\\n- `kid`: Key ID for identifying the signing key\\\\n\\\\nThe protected header **MAY** include:\\\\n\\\\n- `jku`: URL to JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) containing the public key\\\\n\\\\n**Signature Generation Process:**\\\\n\\\\n1. **Prepare the payload:**\\\\n   - Remove properties with default values from the Agent Card\\\\n   - Exclude the `signatures` field\\\\n   - Canonicalize the resulting JSON using RFC 8785 to produce the canonical payload\\\\n2. **Create the protected header:**\\\\n   - Construct a JSON object with the required header parameters (`alg`, `typ`, `kid`) and any optional parameters (`jku`)\\\\n   - Serialize the header to JSON\\\\n   - Base64url-encode the serialized header to produce the `protected` field value\\\\n3. **Compute the signature:**\\\\n   - Construct the JWS Signing Input: `ASCII(BASE64URL(UTF8(JWS Protected Header)) || \\'.\\' || BASE64URL(JWS Payload))`\\\\n   - Sign the JWS Signing Input using the algorithm specified in the `alg` header parameter and the private key\\\\n   - Base64url-encode the resulting signature bytes to produce the `signature` field value\\\\n4. **Assemble the AgentCardSignature:**\\\\n   - Set `protected` to the base64url-encoded protected header from step 2\\\\n   - Set `signature` to the base64url-encoded signature value from step 3\\\\n   - Optionally set `header` to a JSON object containing any unprotected header parameters.\\\\n\\\\n**Example:**\\\\n\\\\nGiven a canonical Agent Card payload and signing key, the signature generation produces:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\n  \\\\\"protected\\\\\": \\\\\"eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpPU0UiLCJraWQiOiJrZXktMSIsImprdSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZXhhbXBsZS5jb20vYWdlbnQvandrcy5qc29uIn0\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"signature\\\\\": \\\\\"QFdkNLNszlGj3z3u0YQGt_T9LixY3qtdQpZmsTdDHDe3fXV9y9-B3m2-XgCpzuhiLt8E0tV6HXoZKHv4GtHgKQ\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWhere the `protected` value decodes to:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\\"alg\\\\\":\\\\\"ES256\\\\\",\\\\\"typ\\\\\":\\\\\"JOSE\\\\\",\\\\\"kid\\\\\":\\\\\"key-1\\\\\",\\\\\"jku\\\\\":\\\\\"https://example.com/agent/jwks.json\\\\\"}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### 8.4.3. Signature Verification [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#843-signature-verification \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nClients verifying Agent Card signatures **MUST**:\\\\n\\\\n1. Extract the signature from the `signatures` array\\\\n2. Retrieve the public key using the `kid` and `jku` (or from a trusted key store)\\\\n3. Remove properties with default values from the received Agent Card\\\\n4. Exclude the `signatures` field\\\\n5. Canonicalize the resulting JSON using RFC 8785\\\\n6.

Custom Binding Guidelines [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#12-custom-binding-guidelines \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nWhile the A2A protocol provides three standard bindings (JSON-RPC, gRPC, and HTTP+JSON/REST), implementers **MAY** create custom protocol bindings to support additional transport mechanisms or communication patterns. Custom bindings **MUST** comply with all requirements defined in [Section 5 (Protocol Binding Requirements and Interoperability)](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#5-protocol-binding-requirements-and-interoperability). This section provides additional guidelines specific to developing custom bindings.\\\\n\\\\n### 12.1. Binding Requirements [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#121-binding-requirements \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nCustom protocol bindings **MUST**:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Implement All Core Operations**: Support all operations defined in [Section 3 (A2A Protocol Operations)](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#3-a2a-protocol-operations)\\\\n2. **Preserve Data Model**: Use data structures functionally equivalent to those defined in [Section 4 (Protocol Data Model)](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#4-protocol-data-model)\\\\n3. **Maintain Semantics**: Ensure operations behave consistently with the abstract operation definitions\\\\n4. **Document Completely**: Provide comprehensive documentation of the binding specification\\\\n\\\\n### 12.2. Data Type Mappings [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#122-data-type-mappings \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nCustom bindings **MUST** provide clear mappings for:\\\\n\\\\n- **Protocol Buffer Types**: Define how each Protocol Buffer message type is represented\\\\n- **Timestamps**: Follow the conventions in [Section 5.6.1 (Timestamps)](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#561-timestamps)\\\\n- **Binary Data**: Specify encoding for binary content (e.g., base64 for text-based protocols)\\\\n- **Enumerations**: Define representation of enum values (e.g., strings, integers)\\\\n\\\\n### 12.3. Service Parameter Transmission [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#123-service-parameter-transmission \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nAs specified in [Section 3.2.6 (Service Parameters)](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#326-service-parameters), custom protocol bindings **MUST** document how service parameters are transmitted. The binding specification **MUST** address:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Transmission Mechanism**: The protocol-specific method for transmitting service parameter key-value pairs\\\\n2. **Value Constraints**: Any limitations on service parameter values (e.g., character encoding, size limits)\\\\n3. **Reserved Names**: Any service parameter names reserved by the binding itself\\\\n4. **Fallback Strategy**: What happens when the protocol lacks native header support (e.g., passing service parameters in metadata)\\\\n\\\\n**Example Documentation Requirements:**\\\\n\\\\n- **For native header support**: \\\\\"Service parameters are transmitted using HTTP request headers. Service parameter keys are case-insensitive and must conform to RFC 7230. Service parameter values must be UTF-8 strings.\\\\\"\\\\n- **For protocols without headers**: \\\\\"Service parameters are serialized as a JSON object and transmitted in the request metadata field `a2a-service-parameters`.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n### 12.4. Error Mapping [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#124-error-mapping \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nCustom bindings **MUST**:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Map Standard Errors**: Provide mappings for all A2A-specific error types defined in [Section 3.2.2 (Error Handling)](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/#332-error-handling)\\\\n2. **Preserve Error Information**: Ensure error details are accessible to clients\\\\n3. **Use Appropriate Codes**: Map to protocol-native error codes where applicable\\\\n4. **Document Error Format**: Specify the structure of error responses\\\\n\\\\n### 12.5. Streaming Support [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#125-streaming-support \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nIf the binding supports streaming operations:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Define Stream Mechanism**: Document how streaming is implemented (e.g., WebSockets, long-polling, chunked encoding)\\\\n2. **Event Ordering**: Specify ordering guarantees for streaming events\\\\n3. **Reconnection**: Define behavior for connection interruption and resumption\\\\n4. **Stream Termination**: Specify how stream completion is signaled\\\\n\\\\nIf streaming is not supported, the binding **MUST** clearly document this limitation in the Agent Card.\\\\n\\\\n### 12.6. Authentication and Authorization [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#126-authentication-and-authorization \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nCustom bindings **MUST**:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Support Standard Schemes**: Implement authentication schemes declared in the Agent Card\\\\n2. **Document Integration**: Specify how credentials are transmitted in the protocol\\\\n3. **Handle Challenges**: Define how authentication challenges are communicated\\\\n4. **Maintain Security**: Follow security best practices for the transport protocol\\\\n\\\\n### 12.7. Agent Card Declaration [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#127-agent-card-declaration \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nCustom bindings **MUST** be declared in the Agent Card:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Transport Identifier**: Use a clear, descriptive transport name\\\\n2. **Endpoint URL**: Provide the full URL where the binding is available\\\\n3. **Documentation Link**: Include a URL to the complete binding specification\\\\n\\\\n**Example:**\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\n  \\\\\"supportedInterfaces\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\"url\\\\\": \\\\\"wss://agent.example.com/a2a/websocket\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\"protocolBinding\\\\\": \\\\\"WEBSOCKET\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\\\\\n  ]\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### 12.8. Interoperability Testing [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#128-interoperability-testing \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nCustom binding implementers **SHOULD**:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Test Against Reference**: Verify behavior matches standard bindings\\\\n2. **Document Differences**: Clearly note any deviations from standard binding behavior\\\\n3. **Provide Examples**: Include sample requests and responses\\\\n4. **Test Edge Cases**: Verify handling of error conditions, large payloads, and long-running tasks\\\\n\\\\n## 13\\\\\\\\.

This affects `Part` types and streaming event types.\\\\n\\\\n**Legacy Pattern (v0.3.x):**\\\\nObjects used an inline `kind` field as a discriminator to identify the object type:\\\\n\\\\n**Example 1 - TextPart:**\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\n  \\\\\"kind\\\\\": \\\\\"TextPart\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Hello, world!\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Example 2 - FilePart:**\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\n  \\\\\"kind\\\\\": \\\\\"FilePart\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"mimeType\\\\\": \\\\\"image/png\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"name\\\\\": \\\\\"diagram.png\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\"fileWithBytes\\\\\": \\\\\"iVBORw0KGgo...\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Current Pattern (v1.0):**\\\\nObjects now use the **JSON member name** itself to identify the type. The member name acts as the discriminator, and the value structure depends on the specific type:\\\\n\\\\n**Example 1 - TextPart:**\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\n  \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"Hello, world!\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Example 2 - FilePart:**\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\n  \\\\\"file\\\\\": {\\\\n    \\\\\"mediaType\\\\\": \\\\\"image/png\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"name\\\\\": \\\\\"diagram.png\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"fileWithBytes\\\\\": \\\\\"iVBORw0KGgo...\\\\\"\\\\n  }\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Affected Types:**\\\\n\\\\n1. **Part Union Types**:\\\\n2. **TextPart**:\\\\n   - **Legacy:**`{ \\\\\"kind\\\\\": \\\\\"TextPart\\\\\", \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"...\\\\\" }`\\\\n   - **Current:**`{ \\\\\"text\\\\\": \\\\\"...\\\\\" }` (direct string value)\\\\n3. **FilePart**:\\\\n   - **Legacy:**`{ \\\\\"kind\\\\\": \\\\\"FilePart\\\\\", \\\\\"mimeType\\\\\": \\\\\"...\\\\\", \\\\\"name\\\\\": \\\\\"...\\\\\", \\\\\"fileWithBytes\\\\\": \\\\\"...\\\\\" }`\\\\n   - **Current:**`{ \\\\\"file\\\\\": { \\\\\"mediaType\\\\\": \\\\\"...\\\\\", \\\\\"name\\\\\": \\\\\"...\\\\\", \\\\\"fileWithBytes\\\\\": \\\\\"...\\\\\" } }`\\\\n4. **DataPart**:\\\\n   - **Legacy:**`{ \\\\\"kind\\\\\": \\\\\"DataPart\\\\\", \\\\\"data\\\\\": {...} }`\\\\n   - **Current:**`{ \\\\\"data\\\\\": { \\\\\"data\\\\\": {...} } }`\\\\n5. **Streaming Event Types**:\\\\n\\\\n6. **TaskStatusUpdateEvent**:\\\\n   - **Legacy:**`{ \\\\\"kind\\\\\": \\\\\"TaskStatusUpdateEvent\\\\\", \\\\\"taskId\\\\\": \\\\\"...\\\\\", \\\\\"status\\\\\": {...} }`\\\\n   - **Current:**`{ \\\\\"statusUpdate\\\\\": { \\\\\"taskId\\\\\": \\\\\"...\\\\\", \\\\\"status\\\\\": {...} } }`\\\\n7. **TaskArtifactUpdateEvent**:\\\\n   - **Legacy:**`{ \\\\\"kind\\\\\": \\\\\"TaskArtifactUpdateEvent\\\\\", \\\\\"taskId\\\\\": \\\\\"...\\\\\", \\\\\"artifact\\\\\": {...} }`\\\\n   - **Current:**`{ \\\\\"artifactUpdate\\\\\": { \\\\\"taskId\\\\\": \\\\\"...\\\\\", \\\\\"artifact\\\\\": {...} } }`\\\\n\\\\n**Migration Strategy:**\\\\n\\\\nFor **Clients** upgrading from pre-0.3.x:\\\\n\\\\n1. Update parsers to expect wrapper objects with member names as discriminators\\\\n2. When constructing requests, use the new wrapper format\\\\n3. Implement version detection based on the agent\\'s `protocolVersions` in the `AgentCard`\\\\n4. Consider maintaining backward compatibility by detecting and handling both formats during a transition period\\\\n\\\\nFor **Servers** upgrading from pre-0.3.x:\\\\n\\\\n1. Update serialization logic to emit wrapper objects\\\\n2. **Breaking:** The `kind` field is no longer part of the protocol and should not be emitted\\\\n3. Update deserialization to expect wrapper objects with member names\\\\n4. Ensure the `AgentCard` declares the correct `protocolVersions` (e.g., \\\\\\\\[\\\\\"1.0\\\\\"\\\\\\\\] or later)\\\\n\\\\n**Rationale:**\\\\n\\\\nThis change aligns with modern API design practices and Protocol Buffers\\' `oneof` semantics, where the field name itself serves as the type discriminator. This approach:\\\\n\\\\n- Reduces redundancy (no need for both a field name and a `kind` value)\\\\n- Aligns JSON-RPC and gRPC representations more closely\\\\n- Simplifies code generation from schema definitions\\\\n- Eliminates the need for representing inheritance structures in schema languages\\\\n- Improves type safety in strongly-typed languages\\\\n\\\\n#### A.2.2 Breaking Change: Extended Agent Card Field Relocated [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#a22-breaking-change-extended-agent-card-field-relocated \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\n**Version 1.0 relocates the extended agent card capability** from a top-level field to the capabilities object for architectural consistency.\\\\n\\\\n**Legacy Structure (pre-1.0):**\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\n  \\\\\"supportsExtendedAgentCard\\\\\": true,\\\\n  \\\\\"capabilities\\\\\": {\\\\n    \\\\\"streaming\\\\\": true\\\\n  }\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Current Structure (1.0+):**\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n{\\\\n  \\\\\"capabilities\\\\\": {\\\\n    \\\\\"streaming\\\\\": true,\\\\n    \\\\\"extendedAgentCard\\\\\": true\\\\n  }\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Proto Changes:**\\\\n\\\\n- Removed: `AgentCard.supports_extended_agent_card` (field 13)\\\\n- Added: `AgentCapabilities.extended_agent_card` (field 5)\\\\n\\\\n**Migration Steps:**\\\\n\\\\nFor **Agent Implementations**:\\\\n\\\\n1. Remove `supportsExtendedAgentCard` from top-level AgentCard\\\\n2. Add `extendedAgentCard` to `capabilities` object\\\\n3. Update validation: `agentCard.capabilities?.extendedAgentCard`\\\\n\\\\nFor **Client Implementations**:\\\\n\\\\n1. Update capability checks: `agentCard.capabilities?.extendedAgentCard`\\\\n2. Temporary fallback (transition period):\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nconst supported = agentCard.capabilities?.extendedAgentCard ||\\\\n                  agentCard.supportsExtendedAgentCard;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n1. Remove fallback after agent ecosystem migrates\\\\n\\\\nFor **SDK Developers**:\\\\n\\\\n1. Regenerate code from updated proto\\\\n2. Update type definitions\\\\n3. Document breaking change in release notes\\\\n\\\\n**Rationale:**\\\\n\\\\nAll optional features enabling specific operations (`streaming`, `pushNotifications`, `stateTransitionHistory`) reside in `AgentCapabilities`. Moving `extendedAgentCard` achieves:\\\\n\\\\n- Architectural consistency\\\\n- Improved discoverability\\\\n- Semantic correctness (it is a capability)\\\\n\\\\n### A.3 Future Automation [¶](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\\\\\\\#a3-future-automation \\\\\"Permanent link\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nOnce the proto→schema generation pipeline lands, this appendix will be partially auto-generated (legacy mapping table sourced from a maintained manifest).

Think of MCP as the \\\\\"how-to\\\\\" for an agent to _use_ a specific capability or access a resource.\\\\n- **Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A):** Focuses on standardizing how independent, often opaque, **AI agents communicate and collaborate with each other as peers.** A2A provides an application-level protocol for agents to discover each other, negotiate interaction modalities, manage shared tasks, and exchange conversational context or complex results. It\\'s about how agents _partner_ or _delegate_ work.\\\\n\\\\n**How they work together:**\\\\nAn A2A Client agent might request an A2A Server agent to perform a complex task. The Server agent, in turn, might use MCP to interact with several underlying tools, APIs, or data sources to gather information or perform actions necessary to fulfill the A2A task.\\\\n\\\\nFor a more detailed comparison, see the [A2A and MCP guide](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/topics/a2a-and-mcp/).\\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\nBack to top\",\\n  \"metadata\": {\\n    \"generator\": \"mkdocs-1.6.1, mkdocs-material-9.7.1\",\\n    \"theme-color\": \"#00000000\",\\n    \"title\": \"Overview - A2A Protocol\",\\n    \"language\": \"en\",\\n    \"color-scheme\": \"normal\",\\n    \"viewport\": \"width=device-width,initial-scale=1\",\\n    \"description\": \"The official documentation for the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol.

Think of it as a standardized \"internet\" and API model for autonomous AI agents.\\n- Design goals: interoperability, discoverability, collaboration (task delegation), async-first/long-running tasks, modality-agnostic (text, files, structured data, media), and enterprise-ready security/tracing/authorization.\\n\\nKey technical ideas (high-level)\\n- Agent Card: a self-describing JSON manifest an agent publishes that lists identity, endpoints, capabilities, skills, security requirements, and supported protocol bindings.\\n- Messages & Tasks: client sends a Message (one or more Parts — text, file, or structured data). The agent may return a Task (stateful unit of work) that can be polled, streamed, or delivered via push notifications (webhooks).\\n- Parts / Artifacts: message and artifact model supports text, files (URI or bytes), and JSON structured data.\\n- Update delivery: polling (GetTask), streaming (SSE/gRPC streaming), or push notifications/webhooks.\\n- Bindings: canonical data model + concrete bindings for HTTP/JSON REST, JSON-RPC, and gRPC (protobufs). Spec uses a proto (a2a.proto) as the normative source.\\n- Extensions: versioned extension mechanism so agents can opt into domain-specific features (e.g., geolocation, citations).\\n\\nSecurity & enterprise controls\\n- AuthN/AuthZ, signed Agent Cards, TLS, webhook authentication, capability validation, scoped data access, and guidelines for canonicalizing and signing Agent Cards (JWS + RFC8785 canonical JSON) to ensure integrity/trust in discovery.\\n\\nGoogle\\'s rollout / ecosystem\\n- Google announced and pushed A2A in 2025, has integrated support into Google tooling (Agent Development Kit / ADK, Agent Engine, Cloud Run, GKE, Agentspace, Vertex GenAI evaluation, AI Agent Marketplace) and released A2A SDKs/ADK integrations and sample tooling.\\n- Google contributed the protocol to the Linux Foundation; the ecosystem quickly gained many partners (100s of orgs reported in the community pages).\\n- Current publicly published spec and releases: v0.3.0 (stabilized interfaces, gRPC support, signed agent cards, extended Python SDK, etc.).\\n\\nWhere to read the official spec and Google’s writeup\\n- A2A protocol specification (canonical technical spec): https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/\\n- Google Cloud blog post about A2A tooling and updates: https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/agent2agent-protocol-is-getting-an-upgrade\\n\\nIf you want\\n- I can summarize the spec into a one-page quickstart (how to discover an agent, send a message, receive a task, use streaming or webhooks) or give starter code examples for HTTP/gRPC/JSON-RPC.
